#OVERVIEW
This is my real time chat application that I built using JavaScript, HTML, and node.js.
It allows the useers to exchange messages in a browser based interface.
I used server-client architeture for asynchronous communication. 
This app showcases web development and real time interactions using HTTP protocals.

#FEATURES
users are prompted to enter a username before accesing chat.
Each user is given a unique client ID.
Chat bubbles to distinguish between user and other user messages.
A server side array stores all chat messages for retrieval.
